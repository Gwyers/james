    <h2>about</h2>
    <p>I created this website originally as a "slightly more modern" version of my dad's old website <a href="https://j8g.co.uk" target="_blank">j8g.co.uk</a>. However, I did want to keep as much as possible similar, which is why most pages on this website do look very basic. But this is also for longevity purposes.</p>
    <h2>how and why?</h2>
    <p>I've written more about this <a href="https://garden.jamesgwyer.com/notebook/remaking-j8g.html" target="_blank">here</a> but, long story short, I really liked how my dad archived his old cars on the site and wanted to do something similar. But, for longevity and ease, I've just used HTML and some styling for this website.</p>
